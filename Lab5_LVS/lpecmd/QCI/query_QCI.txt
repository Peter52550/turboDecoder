## Note that the output directory and file name prefix are consistent
## for all output files. This is an important consideration for running
## QRC with the Calibre input data.
## The QRC input_db -directory_name command argument equates to the
## query output directory (query_output)
## The QRC input_db -run_name command equates to the file name
## prefix (Design) for all query output files.

## If applicable, the query output log file will report the (filename) of the
## LVS PUSH DEVICES SEPARATE PROPERTIES "(file_name)"
## The (filename) is relative to the Calibre LVS rundir.
